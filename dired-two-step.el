;;; Commentary:
;; TODO Add two step cut paste
;; This package provides a two-step copy-paste functionality for Dired,
;; allowing users to copy files and directories incrementally and
;; paste them in another Dired buffer.  The copy buffer is cleared
;; after pasting, making it a safer alternative to traditional copy-paste
;; operations.

;; Enhanced features:
;; - Press 'y' to:
;;   * Copy marked files/directories (if marks exist)
;;   * Append current file to copy list (if no marks)
;; - Press 'C-y' to paste all collected files/directories
;; Usage:
;;
;; 1. Either:
;;    - Mark multiple files and press 'y' to copy them all, or
;;    - Press 'y' on individual files to add them to copy list
;; 2. Navigate to destination directory
;; 3. Press 'C-y' to paste all collected items
