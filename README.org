that allows collecting multiple files before pasting.

On a file: adds it to the copy list
On marked files: adds all marked files to the copy list
Duplicate files are automatically ignored

Press =C-y= in any dired buffer to paste all collected files.
The copy list is automatically cleared after pasting.
